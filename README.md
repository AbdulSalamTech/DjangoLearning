# DjangoLearning
I am learning Django. In this repo I shall practice Django projects to master Django concepts and in particular learning about web applications. I am also practicing git to work in big projects one reason to upload my code on GitHub is to practice git so I might be familiar with git concepts and use it in my projects.
